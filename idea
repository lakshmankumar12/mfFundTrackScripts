TO make a program that does

-> Ask for 2 dates
    -> Optimizations are 
       -> last one months
       -> last 6 months
       -> last 1 yr
       -> last 3 years
       -> last 5 years.
-> Should give the sorted list of funds on the cagr of their nav between these 2 dates
-> Should validate whether fund is present in master list first
-> Should validate whether this fund is available in both dates daily-nav file.
-> Should provide missing list of funds in either dates 

How files are stored:

The script will always work in a directory and a repo direct is a sub-dir of cwd of script
The repo dir has master list in clear text format.
The repo dir has a archive list that stores the daily-nav of every day for a month. So there is archive for every month



Need:
-> One standard format that just has 
     Fund-name and nav separated by ; The file name itself is the date in form yyyy-mm-dd-nav.
      -> Need a converter script that is able to prepare this file both from today-nav and historical-nav formats
      -> today-nav will named yyyy-mm-dd-today and historical will be named yyyy-mm-dd-hist
      -> we will call this daily-nav-format
-> list of overall available funds.
    -> This is called master list
    -> This is of the same format as daily-nav and has 1 more column extra. This tells what type of fund it is.
    -> Types are those listed in today-nav format.
-> a script that updates master list when given a daily-nav
    -> This should update master list and optionally report
      -> what was updated in master list 
      -> what is missing in this list.
      -> As to updating type in master, it is left blank. There wlil be another script that will update type from a today-nav file
-> Does fund
